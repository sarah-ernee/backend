# Getting started
APIs are written using Golang because I like being able to do proper error handling and is more type strict compared to Python.
CORS handlers and Gorilla mux router packages are used here.

1. Run `go mod tidy` to make sure that necessary packages are installed. Eg, Gorilla Mux router is used here to write my APIs.
2. Run API server with `go run main.go`.
